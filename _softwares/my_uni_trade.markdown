Built as a textbook exchange targeted at university students, My Uni Trade was developed over a summer with a friend.
The project itself was proposed by two acquaintances, who had big plans to launch at the start of the school semester and get a lot of natural traction.
The site did get quite a bit of traffic, peaking at over 1000 hits in a day, but the traffic quickly died. As it turns out, a site centered
around selling used textbooks only has gets traffic 2 times a year; September and January. The project was shelved after a few months.

The application was built on Rails and is backed by a Postgresql DB, the frontend uses basic html with bootstrap and custom styles.
All uploads are resized into needed sizes and pushed into S3.
