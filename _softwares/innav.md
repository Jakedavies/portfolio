Innav is a project I am working on for my Honors thesis.
The core of it is an android app targeted to the blind, that will aid in indoor navigation.

The core of the app consists of a navigational screen that pivots with the user allowing them to "feel" their surroundings. 
It utilizes iBeacon technology to get indoor positioning data. 
Our case is building an application that can be used by a blind person to navigate a grocery store, but the technology can be easily applied to any location.

> The map pivots with the user to display the objects in front of the phone, allowing a user to "feel" their environment.
