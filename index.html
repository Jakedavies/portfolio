  I am a 4th Year Computer Science Student at the University Of British Columbia. 
  I also work as a full stack software developer at <a href="http://strawhouselabs.com"> Straw House Labs</a> 
  I enjoy solving problems and finding the best way to overcome constraints. 
  I am constantly learning and playing with new technologies. 
  My goal each day I am at my computer is to learn something new about whatever I am working on.

<p> Outside of work and school, I love soccer, electronics and hobby grade RC. I have my own custom built 
quadcopter and a Raspberry Pi I frequently repurpose for different projects.
