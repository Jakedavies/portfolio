## About me

I am a 4th Year Computer Science Student at the University Of British Columbia. 
I also work as a full stack software developer at [Straw House Labs](http://strawhouselabs.com). 
I enjoy solving problems and finding the best way to overcome constraints. 
I am constantly learning and playing with new technologies. 
My goal each day I am at my computer is to learn something new about whatever I am working on.

Outside of work and school, I love soccer, electronics and hobby grade RC. I have my own custom built 
quadcopter and a Raspberry Pi I frequently repurpose for different projects.
